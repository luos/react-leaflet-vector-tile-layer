# React Leaflet Vector Tile Layer

This is based on the work done for React Leaflet Vector Grid but uses the more recent vector tile layer plugin for leaflet (which has better support for different min/max zoom levels).

See examples for an example of how to use it

# Installation

`npm install react-leaflet-vector-tile-layer`
